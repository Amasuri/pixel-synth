# pixel-synth
A simple 8bit-like software synthesizer built on C# &amp; Monogame (XNA). Works on Windows PC! (see [releases](https://github.com/Amasuri/pixel-synth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha) to try it out)

(Latest release: [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Amasuri/pixel-synth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha))

Windows only release.
Unpack & launch PixelSynth.exe!

**Controls for these can be found inside the app:**

- Selecting a default preset
- Saving/Loading user presets
- Selecting ADSR envelopes
- Selecting wave type (sawtooth, triangle, ...)
- Selecting overtone generator type (obertonator)
- Selecting simple effects
- Selecting chord / single note type

**Use QWERTY layout to play notes:**

- Low octave: Lshift -> Rshift
- Mid octave: Caps lock -> all the way to the right
- High octave: Tab -> all the way to the right

(other key layouts are not supported, but I might add them in the future if there's interest)

As this is alpha, comfortable usability is not guaranteed, but the basic functions has been tested. Enjoy!
